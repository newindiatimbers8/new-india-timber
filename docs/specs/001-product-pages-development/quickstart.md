# Quickstart Guide - Product Pages Development

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for implementing comprehensive product pages for New India Timbers' premium timber products with detailed information, high-quality images, and SEO optimization.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- Access to the timber-craft-commerce-hub repository
- Image editing software (optional, for image optimization)
- Basic knowledge of React, TypeScript, and SEO principles

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository (if not already done)
git clone <repository-url>
cd timber-craft-commerce-hub

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### 2. Data Structure Setup
```bash
# Navigate to data directory
cd src/data

# Backup existing products.json
cp products.json products.json.backup

# The enhanced products.json will be created during implementation
```

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Data Model Enhancement

#### Step 1.1: Extend Product Schema
1. **Update TypeScript Types**
   ```bash
   # Edit src/types/Product.ts
   # Add new fields for enhanced product information
   ```

2. **Enhance products.json Structure**
   ```bash
   # Edit src/data/products.json
   # Add comprehensive product data for all 6 timber products
   ```

#### Step 1.2: Image Organization
1. **Create Image Directory Structure**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p public/images/products/red-sal-wood
   mkdir -p public/images/products/australia-honne-wood
   mkdir -p public/images/products/red-meranti-sal-wood
   mkdir -p public/images/products/mahogany-wood
   mkdir -p public/images/products/benin-teak-logs
   mkdir -p public/images/products/tanzania-teak-wood
   ```

2. **Add Product Images**
   - Place hero images in each product directory
   - Add gallery images showing different angles
   - Include grain detail and cross-section images
   - Add application examples

### Phase 2: Component Development

#### Step 2.1: Enhanced Product Detail Page
1. **Update ProductDetailPage Component**
   ```bash
   # Edit src/pages/ProductDetailPage.tsx
   # Implement comprehensive product information display
   ```

2. **Create Product Components**
   ```bash
   # Create src/components/products/ProductSpecifications.tsx
   # Create src/components/products/ProductImages.tsx
   # Create src/components/products/ProductApplications.tsx
   # Create src/components/products/ProductPricing.tsx
   ```

#### Step 2.2: SEO Components
1. **Enhance SEO Components**
   ```bash
   # Update src/components/seo/ProductSchema.tsx
   # Add structured data for products
   ```

2. **Implement Meta Tags**
   ```bash
   # Update page components with dynamic meta tags
   # Ensure unique titles and descriptions for each product
   ```

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization

#### Step 3.1: Image Optimization
1. **Implement Lazy Loading**
   ```bash
   # Add lazy loading to product images
   # Use intersection observer for performance
   ```

2. **Image Format Optimization**
   ```bash
   # Convert images to WebP format
   # Provide JPEG fallbacks
   # Implement responsive image loading
   ```

#### Step 3.2: Code Optimization
1. **Bundle Splitting**
   ```bash
   # Implement dynamic imports for product components
   # Optimize bundle size for product pages
   ```

2. **Caching Strategy**
   ```bash
   # Implement browser caching for static assets
   # Add service worker for offline capability (optional)
   ```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Unit Tests
```bash
# Run component tests
npm run test

# Test product data validation
npm run test:data

# Test SEO components
npm run test:seo
```

### 2. Integration Tests
```bash
# Test product page rendering
npm run test:integration

# Test image loading and optimization
npm run test:images

# Test SEO meta tags
npm run test:seo-integration
```

### 3. Performance Tests
```bash
# Run Lighthouse audits
npm run lighthouse

# Test Core Web Vitals
npm run web-vitals

# Test image loading performance
npm run test:performance
```

### 4. Accessibility Tests
```bash
# Run accessibility audits
npm run a11y

# Test screen reader compatibility
npm run test:screen-reader

# Validate WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
npm run test:wcag
```
