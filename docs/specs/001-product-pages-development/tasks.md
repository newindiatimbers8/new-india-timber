# Tasks: Product Pages Development

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-product-pages-development/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: React/TypeScript stack, web frontend structure
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract Product entity → model tasks
   → contracts/: product-api.yaml → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project structure, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: data models, components, SEO
   → Integration: image optimization, performance
   → Polish: unit tests, accessibility, validation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts
- Focus on mobile-first responsive design
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance throughout
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - product-api.yaml → contract test task [P]
   - API endpoints → implementation tasks

2. **From Data Model**:
   - Product entity → model creation tasks [P]
   - Image management → component tasks [P]
   - SEO data → SEO implementation tasks [P]

3. **From User Stories**:
   - Builder/contractor story → integration test [P]
   - Furniture manufacturer story → integration test [P]
   - Homeowner story → integration test [P]
   - SEO user story → integration test [P]

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Models → Components → Integration → Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution
