# Database Setup Summary

## Overview

I have successfully created the database setup infrastructure for the Timber Craft Commerce Hub project. Due to limitations in the Appwrite SDK v19, the database and collections need to be created manually through the Appwrite console.

## What Was Created

### 1. Setup Scripts
- `scripts/setup-manual.mjs` - Comprehensive manual setup guide
- `scripts/setup-databases.mjs` - Database setup script (for future SDK versions)
- `scripts/setup-storage.mjs` - Storage setup script (for future SDK versions)
- `scripts/setup-appwrite.mjs` - Complete setup orchestrator
- `scripts/test-appwrite.mjs` - SDK method testing script

### 2. Documentation
- `docs/DATABASE_SETUP.md` - Detailed setup guide
- `docs/DATABASE_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

### 3. Package.json Scripts
- `npm run setup:manual` - Run manual setup guide
- `npm run setup:appwrite` - Run complete setup (when SDK supports it)
- `npm run setup:database` - Run database setup only
- `npm run setup:storage` - Run storage setup only

## Database Structure

### Main Database
- **ID**: `timbercraft-db`
- **Name**: Timber Craft Commerce Hub

### Collections

1. **users** - User management
   - 8 attributes (name, email, phone, role, profile, address, isActive, lastLogin)
   - Permissions: Read (any), CRUD (users)

2. **products** - Wood products catalog
   - 16 attributes (name, scientificName, category, grade, overview, specifications, etc.)
   - Permissions: Read (any), CRUD (admin team)

3. **orders** - Order management
   - 12 attributes (userId, purpose, frames, deliveryRequired, address, etc.)
   - Permissions: Read/Create (users), Update/Delete (admin team)

4. **estimates** - Price estimates
   - 8 attributes (userId, woodType, dimensions, quantity, customization, etc.)
   - Permissions: Read/Update/Delete (users), Create (any)

5. **seo-settings** - SEO configuration
   - 20 attributes (type, pageId, metaTitle, metaDescription, keywords, etc.)
   - Permissions: All operations (admin team only)

### Storage Buckets

1. **product-images** - Product images and galleries
   - File types: jpg, jpeg, png, webp, gif
   - Max size: 10MB
   - Permissions: Read (any), Write (admin team)

2. **user-files** - User-uploaded documents
   - File types: pdf, doc, docx, jpg, jpeg, png, webp
   - Max size: 5MB
   - Permissions: All operations (users only)

3. **seo-assets** - SEO-related images and assets
   - File types: jpg, jpeg, png, webp, svg, ico
   - Max size: 2MB
   - Permissions: Read (any), Write (admin team)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Run the manual setup guide**:
   ```bash
   npm run setup:manual
   ```

2. **Follow the instructions** to create the database and collections in your Appwrite console

3. **Create an admin team** in your Appwrite project

4. **Test the setup** by creating sample documents and uploading files

### Configuration

Your current configuration:
- **Endpoint**: `https://fra.cloud.appwrite.io/v1`
- **Project ID**: `68b0a743000c98e8ca75`
- **Database ID**: `timbercraft-db`

### Verification

After manual setup, verify:
- [ ] Database `timbercraft-db` exists
- [ ] All 5 collections are created with correct attributes
- [ ] All 3 storage buckets are created with correct permissions
- [ ] Admin team exists and has proper permissions
- [ ] Can create documents in each collection
- [ ] Can upload files to each bucket

## Future Improvements

1. **Automated Setup**: When Appwrite SDK supports programmatic database creation
2. **Data Seeding**: Scripts to populate collections with sample data
3. **Migration Scripts**: For schema updates and data migrations
4. **Backup Scripts**: For database and storage backup/restore

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the Appwrite console for detailed error messages
2. Verify your environment configuration
3. Ensure proper permissions are set
4. Consult the Appwrite documentation
