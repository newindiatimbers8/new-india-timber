With moderate temperatures year-round but significant humidity during monsoon season, proper care is essential for preserving your teak investments.</p><h2>Monsoon Season Care</h2><p>During Karnataka's monsoon months (June-September), teak wood requires special attention. Ensure proper ventilation around teak furniture and avoid placing items directly against walls where moisture can accumulate.</p><h2>Daily Maintenance Tips</h2><p>Regular dusting with a soft, dry cloth helps prevent moisture buildup. For Bangalore homes, we recommend weekly inspection of teak items for any signs of moisture damage or discoloration.</p><h2>Professional Treatment</h2><p>Annual professional treatment with teak oil helps maintain the wood's natural resistance to moisture and insects common in Karnataka's climate.</p>",
