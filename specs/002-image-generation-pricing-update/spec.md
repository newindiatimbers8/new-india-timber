## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A potential customer browsing the timber products website sees high-quality, SEO-optimized images of windows and doors in real building/apartment contexts, and can easily contact for pricing quotes without seeing specific price amounts.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a visitor viewing any product page, **When** they see product images, **Then** all images show the product in realistic building/apartment settings with consistent aspect ratios.
2. **Given** a visitor viewing product pricing sections, **When** they look for price information, **Then** they see "Contact for Quote" instead of specific rupee amounts like ‚Çπ50,000 or ‚Çπ18,000.
3. **Given** a visitor on the Burma Teak Door product page, **When** they view the product gallery, **Then** they see multiple images of the door installed in various building contexts (apartment entrance, villa, commercial building).
4. **Given** a visitor on the Ghana Teak Window product page, **When** they view the product gallery, **Then** they see multiple images of the window installed in various building contexts (residential, commercial, apartment).
5. **Given** a visitor viewing any product with pricing information, **When** they see the pricing section, **Then** the "Contact for Quote" button is prominently displayed and functional.
6. **Given** a search engine crawler indexing the product pages, **When** it processes the images, **Then** all images have proper alt text describing the product in building context for SEO optimization.

### Edge Cases
- Image generation fails: fallback to existing images with proper error handling
- Pricing display inconsistency: all pricing references must show "Contact for Quote"
- Image aspect ratio mismatch: all product images must maintain consistent dimensions
- SEO image optimization: images must be optimized for web performance while maintaining quality

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST generate SEO-optimized images for all window and door products showing them in realistic building/apartment contexts.
- **FR-002**: All product images MUST maintain consistent aspect ratios across the entire product catalog.
- **FR-003**: System MUST replace all specific pricing amounts (‚Çπ50,000, ‚Çπ18,000, etc.) with "Contact for Quote" text throughout the website.
- **FR-004**: Product image galleries MUST display multiple context images showing products in various building settings (residential, commercial, apartment).
- **FR-005**: All generated images MUST include proper alt text for SEO optimization describing the product in building context.
- **FR-006**: Pricing sections MUST maintain all existing functionality (quote buttons, contact forms) while removing specific price amounts.
- **FR-007**: Image generation process MUST not break existing product page functionality or content structure.
- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve all existing product information, specifications, and descriptions during the update process.
- **FR-009**: Generated images MUST be optimized for web performance (appropriate file sizes, formats) while maintaining visual quality.
- **FR-010**: Product pages MUST continue to display trust signals, certifications, and quality information without pricing amounts.
- **FR-011**: Contact for Quote functionality MUST remain fully functional with proper form validation and submission.
- **FR-012**: Image generation MUST support batch processing for multiple products efficiently.

- **FR-014**: SEO metadata and structured data MUST be updated to reflect the new image content and pricing approach.
- **FR-015**: All product categories (teak doors, windows, plywood, hardwood) MUST receive consistent treatment for image generation and pricing updates.

*Examples of ambiguities to resolve:*
- **FR-016**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What specific aspect ratio should be used for all product images?]
- **FR-017**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How many context images should be generated per product?]
- **FR-018**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What building types should be prioritized for image contexts?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Product**: Enhanced with new image URLs, updated pricing display format, SEO-optimized alt text
- **ProductImage**: New entity for generated context images with metadata (building type, context, SEO data)
- **PricingDisplay**: Updated entity structure to support "Contact for Quote" format instead of specific amounts
- **ImageGenerationJob**: Entity to track batch image generation processes and status
- **SEOImageData**: Entity for storing SEO metadata for generated images (alt text, descriptions, keywords)
