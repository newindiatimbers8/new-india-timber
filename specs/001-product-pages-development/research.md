# Research Findings - Product Pages Development

## Technology Stack Research

### React Product Page Architecture
**Decision**: Component-based architecture with reusable product components
**Rationale**: 
- Leverages existing React infrastructure
- Enables code reuse across different product types
- Supports dynamic content loading and SEO optimization
- Integrates well with existing routing and state management

**Alternatives considered**:
- Static site generation (Next.js) - Rejected due to existing Vite setup
- Server-side rendering - Not needed for this frontend-only application

### Image Optimization Strategy
**Decision**: WebP format with JPEG fallbacks, lazy loading, and responsive images
**Rationale**:
- WebP provides 25-35% better compression than JPEG
- Lazy loading improves initial page load performance
- Responsive images ensure optimal loading on different devices
- Fallbacks ensure compatibility with older browsers

**Alternatives considered**:
- AVIF format - Rejected due to limited browser support
- Single large images - Rejected due to performance impact

### SEO Implementation Approach
**Decision**: React Helmet for meta tags, structured data with JSON-LD, and semantic HTML
**Rationale**:
- React Helmet integrates seamlessly with existing React setup
- JSON-LD structured data provides rich snippets for search engines
- Semantic HTML improves accessibility and SEO
- Dynamic meta tag generation based on product data

**Alternatives considered**:
- Next.js SEO - Rejected due to existing Vite setup
- Static meta tags - Rejected due to need for dynamic content

### Performance Optimization
**Decision**: Code splitting, image optimization, and caching strategies
**Rationale**:
- Code splitting reduces initial bundle size
- Image optimization meets performance goals (<3s load time)
- Caching improves repeat visit performance
- Lazy loading reduces initial page weight

**Alternatives considered**:
- Service workers - Rejected as overkill for static content
- CDN implementation - Considered but not required for current scale

## Product Data Structure Research

### Enhanced Product Schema
**Decision**: Extend existing products.json with comprehensive product details
**Rationale**:
- Maintains consistency with existing data structure
- Allows for easy content management
- Supports all required product information fields
- Enables future API integration

**Key additions**:
- Technical specifications (density, grain pattern, workability)
- SEO metadata (meta titles, descriptions, keywords)
- Image gallery with multiple angles and details
- Pricing tiers and availability information
- Related products and cross-references

### Image Management Strategy
**Decision**: Structured image naming convention with multiple variants
**Rationale**:
- Consistent naming enables programmatic image loading
- Multiple variants support responsive design
- Organized structure improves maintainability
- Supports future image optimization automation

**Structure**:
```
public/images/products/{product-slug}/
├── hero.webp (main product image)
├── hero.jpg (fallback)
├── grain-detail.webp
├── cross-section.webp
├── application-1.webp
├── application-2.webp
└── gallery/
    ├── angle-1.webp
    ├── angle-2.webp
    └── texture.webp
```

## SEO Strategy Research

### Keyword Research Approach
**Decision**: Product-specific keywords combined with location and application terms
**Rationale**:
- Product-specific terms capture high-intent traffic
- Location terms target local customers
- Application terms capture use-case specific searches
- Long-tail keywords reduce competition

**Primary keywords per product**:
- Red Sal Wood: "red sal wood", "shorea robusta timber", "construction hardwood"
- Australia Honne: "australia honne wood", "pterocarpus marsupium", "luxury furniture wood"
- Red Meranti Sal: "red meranti sal", "tropical hardwood", "joinery timber"
- Mahogany: "mahogany wood", "swietenia macrophylla", "premium furniture wood"
- Benin Teak: "benin teak logs", "african teak", "marine grade teak"
- Tanzania Teak: "tanzania teak wood", "plantation teak", "sustainable teak"

### Content Strategy
**Decision**: Comprehensive product descriptions with technical details and applications
**Rationale**:
- Detailed content improves SEO rankings
- Technical information serves professional customers
- Application examples help consumer decision-making
- Rich content supports featured snippets

**Content structure**:
- Product overview and key features
- Technical specifications and properties
- Common applications and use cases
- Quality grades and certifications
- Pricing and availability information

## Accessibility Research

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance Strategy
**Decision**: Semantic HTML, proper contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support
**Rationale**:
- Legal compliance requirement
- Improves user experience for all users
- Better SEO performance
- Future-proofs the application

**Implementation approach**:
- Use semantic HTML elements (article, section, h1-h6)
- Ensure 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text
- Implement proper focus management
- Add comprehensive alt text for all images
- Use ARIA labels where needed

### Mobile-First Design Research
**Decision**: Mobile-first responsive design with progressive enhancement
**Rationale**:
- Majority of users access on mobile devices
- Google's mobile-first indexing prioritizes mobile experience
- Better performance on mobile devices
- Easier to scale up than scale down

**Design principles**:
- Touch-friendly interface elements (44px minimum)
- Readable typography without zooming
- Fast loading on slow connections
- Intuitive navigation patterns

## Performance Research

### Core Web Vitals Optimization
**Decision**: Optimize for LCP, FID, and CLS metrics
**Rationale**:
- Google ranking factor
- Directly impacts user experience
- Measurable performance goals
- Industry standard metrics

**Optimization strategies**:
- LCP: Optimize hero images, minimize render-blocking resources
- FID: Reduce JavaScript execution time, optimize event handlers
- CLS: Reserve space for images, avoid layout shifts

### Image Loading Strategy
**Decision**: Lazy loading with intersection observer and placeholder images
**Rationale**:
- Reduces initial page load time
- Improves Core Web Vitals scores
- Better user experience on slow connections
- Reduces bandwidth usage

**Implementation**:
- Lazy load images below the fold
- Use low-quality placeholders during loading
- Implement progressive image enhancement
- Provide loading states and error handling

## Integration Research
